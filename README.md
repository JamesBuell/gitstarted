project for Tania Rascia walkthrough<br/>
Tania Rascia has some great beginner/re-familiarizing tutorials for Git, WordPress, Jekyll, and no doubt other stuff I haven't encountered yet.<br/>
Her Git tutorial can be found here: https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-git/ . This is a sample project I made when walking through that.
